## **How It Works** ðŸ”—  

1. User selects products and adds them to the cart.  
2. At checkout, the app requests a **PaymentIntent** from the **Spring Boot** backend.  
3. The backend calls **Stripe API** to create the PaymentIntent and sends the **client secret** to the app.  
4. The app uses **Stripeâ€™s PaymentLauncher** to confirm the payment.  
5. The user is redirected to:
   - **Success screen** if payment succeeds.  
   - **Failed screen** if payment fails.  

---

## **Future Improvements**
- Add order history and receipts.  
- Support multiple payment methods (Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc.).  
- Improve UI with animations and better product visuals.  
- Implement push notifications for order updates.
- implementing a real API instead of the dummy json API
